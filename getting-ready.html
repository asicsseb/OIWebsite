					<h3>Create or Choose Your Character</h3>
					<p>The games run in Odysseys vary a great deal in terms of genres and rules. Currently we have Steampunk, Post-Apocalyptic, and High Fantasy games that all have at least some variation in the rules for playing, and a variety of differing options for the skills and background of your character. Some of the games that are run don't really have customizable characters for you to play, but rather will have a set of roles you can play. Other games may have pre-built characters as an option in addition to being able to create your own. Typically, we recommend contacting the New Player Liaison or the Head of Plot for the game you want to play to get help building or choosing your character.</p>
					<br>
					<h3>Register for the Event</h3>
					<p>Registering for the event is an easy process. Just click on the Upcoming Events tab, and RSVP. Registering is important to give game runners an idea of how many people to expect at the event, as well as to ensure that enough people are coming to the event to cover the cost of running it.</p>
					<br>
					<h3>What to Bring to the Event</h3>
					<p>Your Costuming:</p>
					<br>
					<p> As a new player, the expectations for your costuming will be relatively low. We understand that you're trying out something new and don't necessarily want to spend a lot of money on this only to realize this isn't something you enjoy. Complicating this even more is that what may be acceptable in one game as costuming, isn't necessarily acceptable in another. For instance blue jeans and a hoody are just fine in our Post-Apocalyptic game, but not really in our High Fantasy and Steampunk games. Things like sweat pants, scrub pants...really any pants with a draw string are pretty safe. The game you are playing may have some tops for you to borrow as well if the requirements are outside of modern outfits. Tunics and vests and long sleeved shirts are typical, though obviously they should be free of any modern print, designs, or wording. With some searching, a lot of this if you don't already have it can be found at thrift stores. Under-Armor (or similar) type clothing can provide a nice base layer that helps with being out in the elements as well.</p>
					<br>
					<br>
					<p>Your Makeup:</p>
					<br>
					<p>If you are playing a character that requires makeup or other props to show off that they are a different humanoid race, you need to have it (horns, elf ears, face paint…) as well as sponges, brushes, spirit gum, etc. to put it on with. Some of this might be available for borrowing from the game for a new player. If you do not have the makeup requirement for your race, you will not get the benefits of that race. There will also always be a playable character race available that does not require any makeup or special props. If you need help with finding or applying makeup, just ask!</p>
					<br>
					<br>
					<p>Your Weapons:</p>
					<br>
					<p>If the game includes weapons or packets, and you are new, you can borrow from NPC camp. After your first event, you can see what they are made of, how they are made, and talk to other players and staff members about what you'd like to make. You will need to get your weapons checked by a marshal at check in, to ensure they are safe to use.</p>
					<br>
					<br>
					<p>Bedding:</p>
					<br>
					<p>If you are attending an event for more than 1 day, and intend on sleeping on site, you will likely need to bring your own bedding. This includes anything from pillows, sheets, blankets, and sleeping bag.</p>
					<br>
					<br>
					<p>Toiletries:</p>
					<br>
					<p>If there is going to be physical activity during the game, or if the event lasts longer then 1 day, you're going to want to be kind to yourself and fellow players and bring the personal items that you will need to be clean and pleasant to be near. Towels, shampoo, soap, washcloth, toothbrush, toothpaste, floss, mouthwash, deodorant, baby-wipes.</p>
