					<p>1. How do I win?</p>
					<br>
					<p>Most of the time, you don't really ever "win". The main games in Odysseys all tell an ongoing story with which the players interact. Through the course of the event or your time playing, you will have many "wins" and "losses", successes and failures. It's not like a board game where there is a clear beginning and an ending, a winner and a loser. On occasion, there are games that will be ran where there are clear objectives for the characters that could be considered win conditions. However, even in these types of games, we want those win conditions to help us tell a good story, instead of being the main objective. </p>
					<br>
					<br>
					<p>2. What Can I do?</p>
					<br>
					<p>What do you want to do? These are games of creativity. You can do anything from high adventure to playing cards in a tavern. Really, you can "try" to do whatever you want. Whether you accomplish it or not, is another thing. There are many non-player-characters (NPCs) in game that can hook you up with adventures or missions. There are other players that need help with things that they are doing. There is also adventure to be had by just exploring the world.</p>
					<br>
					<br>
					<p>3. Is it ALL Combat?</p>
					<br>
					<p>There are some games in the Odysseys organization that are designed to be more combat than others. There are some that are designed to be no combat at all, it really depends on what kind of game you want to play. Even the more combat oriented games will have a high amount of non-combat activities available. If you're the kind of person that wants to hang out and roleplay, you can certainly do that. There are enough PCs and NPCs that you can chat all day.</p>
					<br>
					<br>
					<p>4. Why do you do This?</p>
					<br>
					<p>Why do we live action roleplay? Because it's fun! You get a chance to live the adventure. Instead of sitting around a table rolling dice or just clicking a mouse, you're out there being the character.</p>
					<br>
					<br>
					<p>5. What if I want to be a bad guy?</p>
					<br>
					<p>The easiest way to be a bad guy is to volunteer to NPC for a game. NPC's get to play a variety of characters over the course of an event, and many of them are at odds with the objectives of the players. You can also play your own character and try to be a bad guy (in game), though for continuing games, this isn't easy. Your character should be treated as a real person with real ideas, motivations, short comings, memories and goals. Sometimes you will make good decisions, sometimes you will make bad decisions. If you want to be a "bad guy" coming out of the gate---decide what made you bad. Something in your childhood? Get betrayed by your best friend? If you have a fleshed out character history and are more rounded out than just "a bad guy", your character has more of a chance of survival. If you come into game and are just a total jerk to everyone in game all the time and are stabbing everyone in the back and in the front---the life of your PC will probably be short.</p>
					<br>
					<br>
					<p>6. What Can I be?</p>
					<br>
					<p>The possibilities that answer this question are nearly endless, and only slightly get narrowed down when you start talking about which game you want to play. Really, a thorough reading of the rules or a talk with the New Player Liaison is going to be the best way to answer this question for you.</p>
					<br>
					<br>
					<p>7. I don't want to look dumb my first time out. Can I just buy a nice expensive costume?</p>
					<br>
					<p>If you want to buy a "nice, expensive, costume"...really, then go for it. You can find a lot of things on e-bay, online stores and renaissance faires. I will warn you though, that especially for the first event, to go less expensive and more practical. You may be running around the woods, wearing it for long hours, eating and possibly sleeping in it. Many of our games are very hard on costumes--so do your research when you get your costume, and don't be sad when your $120 velvet cloak is full of sticker burs and slashes from tree branches.</p>
