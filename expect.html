					<p>Coming to an event where you don't know anybody, and you don't know how anything works can be intimidating. To help get you more acclimated with the process, this is a rough outline of what takes place at an event, both in game and out of game.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Depending on the site where the event is being held, Staff will arrive on-site around 3 hours prior to the scheduled start for weekend long events, and 1-2 hours prior for single day events. Usually staff will inform the players when they expect to arrive, and when it is acceptable for players to arrive.</li>
						<li>When players arrive on site, if they are new, their first stop should be finding a member of staff to work out where they should set up their campsites or cabins. After that is done, find the New Player Liaison for that game, and they will work with you to get your character sheet, costuming, and any props you may need, as well as walking you through the basics of the rules, safety speeches, and weapons training.</li>
						<li>When it is time for the event to start, all of the players will gather for some brief announcements and an official call of "Lay-on". The game will run continuously from that point on. Anybody that doesn't have a white headband or a hand on their head can be interacted with.</li>
						<li>We try to encourage (enforce) everyone to stay in-game at all times, or to clearly mark themselves out of game if they must be out of game and are in the game environment. To mark yourself as out of game, you will need a white headband (which is great if you are going to be out of game for more than a few moments) or you can keep your hand or weapon on your head. Generally, it is inconsiderate to spend more than a few moments out-of-game in an in-game areas.</li>
						<li>The game officially ends at the time indicated on the event page. For one day events, this is straightforward enough. For weekend events, often times staff and players will stay up late into the night/early morning and sleep in Sunday morning, though this is not always the case, and it is often possible to find a member of staff and other players to do something if you really want to.</li>
						<li>Some time Sunday morning, everyone begins cleaning up (or they pitch in and clean up before the end of the event if they need to leave sooner). So in practice the games are a bit over 36 hours, but not really 48.</li>
