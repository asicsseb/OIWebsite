					<p>If you still have questions, we understand. We were all once new players. Everything won't be covered in our new player guides or mentioned on the forums. There are even questions you're going to have after playing that you don't know to ask yet, and that's okay. That is what our New Player Liaisons(NPL) are for. Each game has a designated staff member for the sole purpose of helping our new players have an enjoyable experience. They are there to answer your questions, help you build/choose your character, help you with borrowing costuming/props from NPC camp, and to help you with the rules. Below is the contact information for each game's NPL, and if you have trouble getting a hold of them, feel free to contact the game's Head of Plot.</p>
					<br>
					<br>
					<p>This information is forthcoming as we solidify staff positions in our organization. In the meantime, we can be contacted at odysseysrp@gmail.com</p>
